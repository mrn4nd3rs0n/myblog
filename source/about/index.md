Hi, I am Nick Anderson. I am a software engineer from Milwaukee, WI. I work for Goodwill Industries of South Eastern Wisconsin. I design and maintain systems that support more than 60 retail locations. Other than work, I like to spend time with my family, excercise/lift, watch movies, play video games, and race [slot cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car).

I am driven to design solutions that are clear, consistent, organized and exceed expectations. My approach to work and life is to keep it simple and get valuable things done.
